Rust stuff:
- figure out how to mutate struct field with immutable &self.
  - by right this should be impossible,
  - but there is a case where this might be useful.
  - for example: to build a map that lazyly defragment the strucutre,
  - the read operation is immutable, yet there is a change in the structure.
- figure out how to return the same error multiple time
  - sometimes we want to store the error first, and return it to the user later if a function is
    called
  - now, the problem is: who should own the error?
  - and how to return the same error multiple times
  - can we copy the error instead?
