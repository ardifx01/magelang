Rust stuff:
- figure out how to mutate struct field with immutable &self.
  - by right this should be impossible,
  - but there is a case where this might be useful.
  - for example: to build a map that lazyly defragment the strucutre,
  - the read operation is immutable, yet there is a change in the structure.
  - seems the solution is by using some kind of Cell.
